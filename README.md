Welcome to our project! We are happy to present our hard work in building a model that makes pairwise trades on highly correlated stocks based on the mean reversion of the spread between actual and predicted stock prices. In this repository you can find our testing model including the regression analysis as a Jupyter Notebook as well as the notebooks for data collection and processing and correlation analysis. You can also find our report and a link to our presentation. We hope you enjoy.

## Note on Data
Much of our data used to calculate the correlation between stock prices is not included in this repository. The only data included is that needed to run the final backtesting model.

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Inspect (do not run) data-import.ipynb and correlation.ipynb
3. Run the model! Open backtesting-model.ipynb and Run All to see our final tested trading model and see our results!
